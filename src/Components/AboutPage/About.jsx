                    <p>
                        MovieApp is a community-built movie and TV discovery platform powered by The Movie Database (TMDB) API.
                        We provide trailers, overviews, ratings, and moreâ€”all in one place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Designed with a modern and intuitive UI, MovieApp allows users to explore thousands of movies and TV shows from around the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This app is not affiliated with TMDB but utilizes its public API to fetch and display up-to-date movie data.
